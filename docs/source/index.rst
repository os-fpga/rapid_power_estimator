Overview
============

Power and thermal specifications are critical considerations in the early stages of designing SoCs and FPGAs. Determining accurate power requirements and cooling solutions is essential to avoid over-designing or under-designing your product's power and thermal systems. It is a valuable tool in this process.

RPE allows you to estimate power consumption at various stages of your design cycle. It simplifies the input of design information through intuitive wizards and delivers comprehensive power and thermal data analysis.
